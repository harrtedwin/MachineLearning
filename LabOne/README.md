# Endangered Languages Project

### Content
The full detailed dataset includes names of languages, number of speakers, the names of countries where the language is still spoken, and the degree of endangerment. The UNESCO endangerment classification is as follows:

- **Vulnerable**: most children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains (e.g., home)
- **Definitely endangered**: children no longer learn the language as a 'mother tongue' in the home
- **Severely endangered**: language is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves
- **Critically endangered**: the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently
Extinct: there are no speakers left


### Your Tasks
1. How can you best visualize this data?
2. What fraction of the entire dataset have less than 140 speakers.
3. Using a bar chart, visualize how many speakers exists under each degree (obviously extinct wonâ€™t have any speakers at all).
